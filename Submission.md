Actually, I have two submission, ASG Console and myEdda 

## Which Categories Best Fit Your Submission and Why?

1. The ASG Console: Best Contribution to Operational Tools, Availability, and Manageability  
   Since it provides a user friendly conolse for AutoScaling Service, which AWS don't offer, and also you can remotely
   Control your instances other than using some remote control tool, and what makes it more convenient is you can do 
   this to multiple instances at the same time.

2. myEdda: Best usability enhancement
   The original Edda doesn't provide any interface, you need to enter every command in order to keep track of your 
   resource. myEdda provides a web interface for this, which makes it more convenient for using. Also, in order to run
   Edda, we need to a lot of preparaion, which seems not very easy for a newbie, but as for myEdda, it's much more
   easier for launching.

2. AWS Resource View(ARV) is a webapp that allows users to review their AWS resource, which is based on the Netfliex Edda. Information includes EC2 Instance, S3 Buckets, AutoScaling Groups and Security Groups, users can not only keep track of the current information, but can also review the past records. And for instance, it provides advanced search and filter function, allowing users to search their instances using AMI, IP address, tags, etc.
